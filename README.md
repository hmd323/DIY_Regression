# DIY_Regression
For this project I built my own implementations of a set of regression methods without the use of existing regression functions in R. The goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of how regression models work under the hood. 

This repository includes six RMarkdown files, one for each regression function. There is also a PDF file titled "Regression_WriteUp.pdf" with responses to the required written portion of the project path.
